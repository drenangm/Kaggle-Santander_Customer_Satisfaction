# Kaggle_Santander_Customer_Satisfaction

Customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Customers dissatisfied customers cancel their services and wait to express their dissatisfaction before
to leave. Happy customers, on the other hand, become brand advocates!

Banco Santander is asking to help them identify customers dissatisfied at the beginning of the relationship. This would allow Santander take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before they be too late.

In this machine learning project, you'll work with hundreds of anonymous resources to predict whether a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with your banking experience.

Clearly define the business problem, collect and prepare data, choose an algorithm, train the model and evaluate the accuracy, which should be at least minus 70%.
